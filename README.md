doh101: DNS-over-HTTPS using OpenResty, from the IETF 101 Hackathon
===================================================================

[OpenResty](https://openresty.org/) is a distribution of NGINX which
includes LuaJIT and a lot of web application support libraries.

This repository contains an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) role
that sets up an OpenResty server and configures it to support
[DNS-over-TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858) and
[DNS-over-HTTPS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https).
